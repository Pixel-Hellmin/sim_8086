first byte:
----
high 6 bits:
100010 = mov
bit 1:
	determines which reg is the destination and which the src.
	if d bit is 1, reg register is dest
	if d bit is 0, reg register is the src
d
bit 0:
	When the w bit is 0, it means the mov will copy 8 bits.
	If the w bit is 1, it means the mov will copy 16 bits.
	Well, in addition to naming the entire 16-bit register with ax,
	bx, and so on, you can also refer just to the high 8 or
	low 8 bits of a register using “l” and “h”.
w

second byte:
----
hight 2 bits:
mod field
	specifies if mov is between two registers or registers and memory.
	We only care about reg-reg moves, 1 1 is the code for reg to reg move.
bits 5, 4, 3
	The three-bit reg and r/m fields encode the two
	registers involved in the move.
	p 162, intel 8086 manual
reg field
bits 2, 1, 0:
	The three-bit reg and r/m fields encode the two
	registers involved in the move.
	by process of elimination, whichever one the reg(d)
	register is not, the r/m register is.
r/m field
